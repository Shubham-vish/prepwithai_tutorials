1. **Buy when the market is going up**.
2. **Sell when the market is going down**.

This reactive behavior leads them to fall into traps set by the market:

- They place their orders at **obvious levels**, such as resistance or support, making their stop-losses easy targets for institutional players.
- **Big players**, also known as **Smart Money**, use these liquidity pockets to fill their own orders, manipulating price in the process.

## **The Role of Smart Money**

Smart Money refers to **institutional traders**, such as banks and hedge funds, that control large amounts of capital. Their goals are:

- To **manipulate price movements** by hunting liquidity.
- To trap retail traders and profit from their predictable behavior.
