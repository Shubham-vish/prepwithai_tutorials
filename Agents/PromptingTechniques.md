Input: "Customer: My order is late"
Output: [AI follows the empathetic, problem-solving pattern]
```

---

### Technique #3: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting üßÆ

#### What It Is
Chain-of-thought prompting encourages AI to show its reasoning process step-by-step before providing the final answer.

#### How It Works
```
"Let's solve this step by step:

Problem: A company has 100 employees. 60% are engineers, 25% are designers, and the rest are managers. How many managers are there?

Step 1: Calculate engineers: 100 √ó 0.60 = 60
Step 2: Calculate designers: 100 √ó 0.25 = 25
Step 3: Calculate managers: 100 - 60 - 25 = 15

Answer: There are 15 managers."
```

#### When to Use
- **Mathematical problems**
- **Logical reasoning tasks**
- **Complex decision-making scenarios**
- **When you need to verify AI's logic**

#### Pros & Cons
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Slower response times
- May not be needed for simple tasks
- Can be verbose

#### Real-World Example
```
‚ùå Bad CoT:
"Calculate 2+2"
[Unnecessary for simple math]

‚úÖ Good CoT:
"Analyze this business scenario step by step:

Scenario: A startup has $50,000 in revenue, $30,000 in costs, and wants to know if they should hire a new employee for $60,000/year.

Step 1: Calculate current profit: $50,000 - $30,000 = $20,000
Step 2: Calculate new costs with employee: $30,000 + $60,000 = $90,000
Step 3: Determine required revenue increase: $90,000 - $20,000 = $70,000
Step 4: Assess feasibility: Need 140% revenue increase to break even

Conclusion: Hiring this employee would require unrealistic revenue growth. Consider part-time or contract options instead."
```
