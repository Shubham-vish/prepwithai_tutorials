## What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework built entirely from scratch‚Äîcompletely independent of LangChain or other agent frameworks. Created by Joao Moura, it enables developers to build systems where multiple agents collaborate in human-like teams to solve complex tasks.

CrewAI empowers developers with both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control through two main components:

1. **CrewAI Crews**: Optimize for autonomy and collaborative intelligence, enabling you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals.

2. **CrewAI Flows**: Enable granular, event-driven control, single LLM calls for precise task orchestration and support Crews natively.

Unlike frameworks that focus on sequential processes or conversational exchanges, CrewAI emphasizes roles, responsibilities, and task delegation among specialized agents.

## Core Architecture: Role-Based Teamwork

CrewAI's architecture centers around the concept of human team structures, with explicit roles and assigned tasks. This approach is inspired by organizational psychology and team dynamics.

  backstory: >
    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

reporting_analyst:
  role: >
    {topic} Reporting Analyst
  goal: >
    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
    your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
    it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
```

### Example: Defining a Crew
```yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
    Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
    the current year is 2025.
  expected_output: >
    A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
  agent: researcher

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
```
